# Math Libraries

## Project Description

The Math Libraries project is an advanced smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity programming language. This contract provides sophisticated mathematical operations that extend beyond basic arithmetic, offering essential computational functions for complex decentralized applications.

The contract implements two core mathematical functions:
1. **Advanced Power Calculation** - Efficiently computes base^exponent using exponentiation by squaring algorithm with overflow protection
2. **Square Root Approximation** - Calculates square roots using Newton's iterative method with configurable precision

Built with enterprise-grade security and gas optimization in mind, this contract serves as a foundational mathematical library that other smart contracts can integrate to perform complex calculations reliably and efficiently.

## Project Vision
